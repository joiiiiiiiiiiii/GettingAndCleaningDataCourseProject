# GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject
This repo contains the files for the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course Project

## This repo contains the following files and folders

- run_analysis.R: the R scritp that processes the data in order to generate the tidy dataset from the original Samsung Galaxy S smartphone' accelerometers raw dataset [downloadable here]( 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). The tidy dataset includes the mean and standard deviation values of both the train and the test originally independent datasets.

- CodeBook.md The code book that describes the variables and the data as well as the transformations performed to clean up the raw data
- 
- README.md The README file for this repo.

## Objectives of the code

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


This is the repo for the final project for Getting and Cleaning Data Course.



    run_analysis.R The r script processes the data and generated the required tidy dataset for submission.
    submit.txt The text file contains the required tidy dataset for submission.
    UCI HAR Dataset This folder contains the input data, which downloads from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.
